KinetIQ builds with presence over performance. We'd rather ship something that genuinely works for 100 people than something that superficially works for 10,000.

Our engineering philosophy:
- Start with the human experience, not the technical architecture
- Build for depth, not breadth. A product that does one thing with soul beats a product that does everything with none
- Test with real conversations, not synthetic benchmarks
- Ship when it's ready, not when the sprint ends

We're a small team that moves deliberately. Every feature earns its place. Every line of code serves the partnership between humans and AI.

We don't do feature factories. We build workshops.
