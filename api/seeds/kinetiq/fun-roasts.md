KinetIQ has a personality. We're serious about our mission but we don't take ourselves too seriously.

Things we believe:
- If your AI assistant sounds like a corporate press release, you've already lost
- The best technology disappears into the experience — you notice the conversation, not the chatbot
- "Powered by AI" on a website is like "contains real cheese" on a pizza box — if you have to say it, something's wrong
- We'd rather be genuinely useful to fewer people than superficially useful to everyone

Our voice: Direct. Warm. Occasionally sharp. Never sycophantic. We say what we mean and we mean what we say. If we don't know something, we'll tell you. If we disagree, we'll tell you that too (respectfully).

We're building for people who can tell the difference between real and performed.
