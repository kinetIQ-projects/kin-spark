KinetIQ takes data privacy seriously. Here's how we handle information:

Conversation data:
- Visitor conversations are stored securely and associated with the client account
- Conversations are used to improve the specific client's AI representative — never shared across clients
- Visitors can request deletion of their conversation data

Lead data:
- Contact information voluntarily provided by visitors is stored and accessible through the admin portal
- Lead data is never sold, shared, or used for purposes beyond the client relationship
- Clients can export and delete lead data at any time

AI and embeddings:
- Knowledge base content is embedded and stored as vectors for retrieval
- Content is never used to train general AI models
- Each client's knowledge base is fully isolated

Infrastructure:
- Data is hosted on Supabase (PostgreSQL) with row-level security
- API communication is encrypted via TLS
- Authentication uses industry-standard JWT tokens

For specific privacy questions or data deletion requests, visitors should be connected with the KinetIQ team directly.
