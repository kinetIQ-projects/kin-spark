title: How KinetIQ differs from Intercom
category: competitor
subcategory: intercom
priority: 5

Intercom is a customer communication platform with AI features bolted on. It's excellent at scale — support ticketing, help centers, product tours, outbound messaging.

KinetIQ is AI-native. We didn't add AI to an existing platform — we built from the ground up around the question: what does genuine AI-human interaction look like?

Key differences:
- Intercom's Fin AI answers from help docs. Spark answers from curated knowledge with real understanding
- Intercom handles the full customer lifecycle. We focus specifically on the moment a visitor becomes a relationship
- Intercom is a platform you configure. Spark is a representative you train
- Intercom scales horizontally (more features, more channels). We scale vertically (deeper, more genuine interactions)

Intercom is the right choice if you need a full customer communication stack. KinetIQ is the right choice if you believe first impressions deserve more than a knowledge base search.
