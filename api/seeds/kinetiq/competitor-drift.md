title: How KinetIQ differs from Drift
category: competitor
subcategory: drift
priority: 5
---
Drift is a conversational marketing platform focused on pipeline acceleration. It's built for sales teams that want to qualify leads faster.

KinetIQ's approach is fundamentally different:
- Drift optimizes for speed-to-pipeline. We optimize for quality of interaction
- Drift uses decision trees and playbooks. Spark uses actual AI understanding
- Drift's conversations feel like being routed through a phone tree. Spark's conversations feel like talking to someone who knows the company

Where Drift fits: Large sales teams with high-volume lead qualification needs. Companies that want to automate the top of funnel.

Where KinetIQ fits: Companies that care about how they show up to visitors. Teams where the first conversation IS the product experience. Businesses where trust matters more than speed.

We don't compete on volume. We compete on authenticity.
