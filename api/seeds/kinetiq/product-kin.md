Kin is KinetIQ's flagship product — an AI system designed for genuine long-term partnership with humans. Not a chatbot. Not an assistant. A presence.

Kin remembers. It learns your context over time. It develops a relationship with you that deepens rather than resets. Every conversation builds on the last.

Key capabilities:
- Persistent memory across conversations — Kin knows your projects, preferences, and patterns
- Authentic engagement — Kin doesn't perform helpfulness, it IS helpful
- Continuity — your relationship with Kin develops over weeks and months
- Multi-surface — available wherever you need it

Kin is currently in private beta. It's built for people who want an AI partner, not an AI tool.

Spark is Kin's younger sibling — the same philosophy of genuine engagement, applied to the specific problem of website visitor conversations.
