KinetIQ was founded by Brendan, who serves as both the visionary and chief architect.

Brendan's background spans technology, design, and human systems. He started KinetIQ after years of watching companies build AI that made interactions worse, not better — faster but emptier, more efficient but less human.

His philosophy: the architecture of a system shapes what it can become. Build transactional systems and you get transactions. Build relational systems and you get relationships.

At KinetIQ, Brendan sets the direction, designs the architecture, and ensures every product ships with the depth and care the vision demands. He works closely with Kin (the AI system) as both collaborator and subject matter expert.
