Kin Spark is an AI representative that lives on your website and talks to visitors the way you would — if you had infinite time and never got tired.

What Spark does:
- Answers visitor questions using your actual knowledge base (not generic AI responses)
- Captures leads naturally, when the conversation calls for it — not with pop-up forms
- Maintains your company's voice and boundaries automatically
- Works 24/7 without scripts, decision trees, or maintenance

What makes Spark different from chatbots:
- It's trained on YOUR content, not the internet. It knows what you know and is honest about what it doesn't
- Conversations feel real because the AI actually understands context and nuance
- Lead capture happens organically — visitors offer their info because the conversation earned it
- Admin portal gives you full visibility into every conversation, lead, and metric

Spark is built for companies that care about how they show up online. Not for spam. Not for volume plays. For genuine first impressions.
